## Instructions for analyzer setup without Docker

Install python with the version 3.7.4. (it is the version on which the service was developed, but it should work on the versions starting from 3.6).

Perform next steps inside source directory of the analyzer.

### For Linux:

#### Analyzer

1. Create a virtual environment with any name (in the example **/venv**)
```bash
  python -m venv /analyzer
```
2. Install python libraries
```bash
  /analyzer/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
3. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
  /analyzer/bin/activate
```
